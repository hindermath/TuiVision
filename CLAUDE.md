# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TuiVision is a C#/.NET 10 port of the Turbo Vision 2.0.3 TUI framework (originally C/C++). The original source lives in `tv203s/` as the conceptual reference; the C# port is a managed, modernized interpretation — not a line-for-line translation.

## Commands

```bash
# Restore, build, and test (full validation cycle)
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
dotnet test

# Run tests for a specific project
dotnet test tests/TuiVision.Core.Tests/

# Run a single test method
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestMethodName"

# Build generated docs plus Playwright + axe accessibility smoke tests
cd tests/web-a11y
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:docfx

# After every DocFX regeneration, rerun the matching A11y smoke check
docfx docfx.json
cd tests/web-a11y
npm run test:docfx
```

## Architecture

### Module Structure

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/TuiVision.Core` | Foundation types: `TPoint`, `TRect`, `TEvent`, `TObject` |
| `src/TuiVision.Controls` | UI components: `TView` (base for all visual elements) |
| `src/TuiVision.Drivers.Console` | Console rendering: `TConsoleBuffer`, `TConsoleDriver`, `IConsolePresenter` |
| `src/TuiVision.Serialization` | Binary archive system with polymorphic `TRecordRegistry` |
| `src/TuiVision.Compatibility` | Key code translation from .NET keys to Turbo Vision scan codes |

### Key Design Patterns

- **Event system**: `TEvent` uses static factory methods (`TEvent.CreateKeyDown(...)`) and `readonly record struct` payloads. Events are dispatched via `TView.HandleEvent()`.
- **Coordinate system**: `TRect` uses inclusive top-left, exclusive bottom-right bounds. Views maintain local coordinates; `MakeLocal`/`MakeGlobal` convert between coordinate spaces.
- **Console rendering**: Presenter pattern — `TConsoleDriver` manages a back-buffer and publishes snapshots via `IConsolePresenter`, keeping rendering backends swappable.
- **Serialization**: Envelope-based binary format (type ID + payload). Types register themselves with `TRecordRegistry` for polymorphic deserialization.
- **Lifecycle**: `TObject.ShutDown()` for logical teardown + `IDisposable` for resource cleanup.

### Global Build Settings (`Directory.Build.props`)

All projects share: `net10.0`, `LangVersion: latest`, `Nullable: enable`, `ImplicitUsings: enable`.

**Repo Version Scheme** — `Directory.Build.props` carries the repo-wide `Version`, `AssemblyVersion`, and `FileVersion` values for all projects and follows `Major.Minor.Patch.Build`:
- `Minor` = current Spec-Kit feature/branch number, interpreted numerically as the canonical PR number for versioning (`007` -> `7`) and used immediately even before a GitHub PR exists
- `Patch` = current commit count in that feature/PR branch (after committing the current change)
- `Build` = manual build counter incremented before every `dotnet build` or `dotnet test`

Align the three version fields in `Directory.Build.props` whenever a commit is created or the branch is updated on a numbered Spec-Kit branch, before pushing.

### Testing

Tests use MSTest. Test projects mirror source projects (e.g., `TuiVision.Core.Tests` → `TuiVision.Core`). `TuiVision.Examples.SmokeTests` is for integration-level tests of ported example programs.

**Coverage Gate (SC-003)**: `TuiVision.Core`, `TuiVision.Controls`, `TuiVision.Serialization`, `TuiVision.Compatibility`, and `TuiVision.Drivers.Console` must each achieve ≥ 70 % Line Coverage (Pflichtenheft §9.4 Nr. 1). Measure from the repository root with Coverlet (`coverlet.collector`): `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverlet.runsettings`. `coverlet.runsettings` is the canonical TuiVision coverage-gate configuration and MUST be kept in sync when gate-relevant assemblies, example assemblies, or test projects are added, renamed, or removed. Validate it with `xmllint --noout coverlet.runsettings` where available before relying on the coverage gate. Do not merge to `main` without passing this gate.

### Documentation

- Use `System.Text.Json` for project-owned JSON parsing and serialization.
- Introduce `Newtonsoft.Json` only with documented justification and explicit
  reviewer approval.
- Explanatory documentation must be bilingual (German first, English second) with CEFR-B2 readability.
- Large normative documents such as `Pflichtenheft*.md` and `Lastenheft*.md` may use a synchronized English sidecar with suffix `.EN.md` instead of an oversized inline-bilingual file; the German version remains canonical unless explicitly marked otherwise.
- **`Programmierung #include<everyone>`** — Diese Lernbeispiele richten sich an Azubis (Fachinformatiker AE/SI) mit Deutsch und Englisch als Arbeitssprachen sowie an sehbehinderte Lernende, die mit Braille-Displays, Screen-Readern oder Textbrowsern arbeiten. Barrierefreiheit ist kein Nice-to-have, sondern Pflichtanforderung. Guides, statistics, examples, and generated API documentation must remain usable in text-first assistive setups such as Braille displays, screen readers, and text browsers.
- Generated HTML documentation should target WCAG 2.2 conformance level AA as the accessibility baseline.
- Prefer semantic headings, lists, tables, and ASCII/text-first diagrams; do not encode essential meaning only through color, layout, or pointer-only affordances.
- Treat bilingual CEFR-B2 delivery and the documented A11Y proof path as formal completion criteria for learner-facing documentation and active requirement artifacts.
- Public API changes must include complete XML documentation updates.
- New or changed non-trivial logic must be reviewed for didactic inline-comment value when it affects learner understanding or maintainability, especially central framework flows and smoke-test helpers.
- Inline comments explain why a decision, trade-off, constraint, historical deviation, or proof boundary exists; do not add comments that merely restate obvious code.
- Keep inline-comment intensity moderate: normally 1-3 lines before a non-trivial block, with German-first/English-second CEFR-B2 text for didactic explanation blocks.
- Run `docfx docfx.json` when root config exists and API/XML docs changed.
- Keep the Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` smoke tests in `tests/web-a11y/` aligned with the current DocFX structure and representative pages; use `lynx` as an additional text-browser spot check when available.
- Treat every successful `docfx docfx.json` regeneration as incomplete until the matching `tests/web-a11y/` A11y smoke check has also passed in the same work item.
- GitHub Pages is published from `.github/workflows/pages.yml`: build root `docfx.json`, run the `tests/web-a11y/` Playwright + axe smoke path, upload `_site/` as a Pages artifact, and keep `_site/` plus generated `api/*.yml` files out of Git.

### Reference Source

`tv203s/contrib/tvision/` contains the original Turbo Vision 2.0.3 C/C++ source. Consult it when porting new classes or understanding original behavior. Do not modify files in `tv203s/`.

## Historical Source Reference Policy

- Fuer jede Spec-Kit-Feature-Implementierung, die historisch abgeleitetes Turbo-Vision-Verhalten portiert, erweitert, testet, dokumentiert oder korrigiert, muessen die relevanten historischen Implementierungsdateien unter `tv203s/` als Read-only-Referenz geprueft werden. Das betrifft mindestens passende `.c`- und `.cc`-Dateien.
- Falls Typen, Konstanten, Makros, Datenlayout, Vererbung, Funktionssignaturen oder Kontext nur ueber Deklarationen klar werden, muessen auch die relevanten C/C++-Header wie `.h`, `.hpp` oder `.hh` geprueft werden.
- `tv203s/` wird nicht veraendert. Die C#-Portierung bleibt eine moderne, idiomatische Umsetzung der historischen Absicht und keine mechanische 1:1-Uebersetzung.
- `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, Guides, PR-Evidence oder Architektur-/Security-Nachweise muessen bei relevanten Features festhalten, welcher historische Zweck uebernommen wird und welche wesentlichen nutzer- oder API-sichtbaren Abweichungen bewusst sind.
- Wenn ein Feature keinen historischen `tv203s`-Bezug hat, genuegt ein kurzes `N/A` mit Begruendung in Plan, Aufgaben oder Evidence.

- For every Spec-Kit feature implementation that ports, extends, tests, documents, or fixes historically derived Turbo Vision behavior, review the relevant historical implementation files under `tv203s/` as read-only reference. This includes at least the matching `.c` and `.cc` files.
- When types, constants, macros, data layout, inheritance, function signatures, or context are only clear from declarations, also review the relevant C/C++ headers such as `.h`, `.hpp`, or `.hh`.
- Do not modify `tv203s/`. The C# port remains a modern idiomatic implementation of the historical intent, not a mechanical line-by-line translation.
- For relevant features, `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, guides, PR evidence, or architecture/security evidence must record which historical intent is followed and which material user-visible or API-visible deviations are intentional.
- If a feature has no historical `tv203s` relevance, a short `N/A` rationale in plan, tasks, or evidence is sufficient.

## Branching Convention

Feature branches use either the agent-prefixed form `codex/<feature-description>` (or another supported agent prefix such as `claude/`, `gemini/`, `copilot/`, `opencode/`) or the numbered Spec-Kit form `NNN-short-description` when the Spec-Kit workflow creates the branch. CI runs on pushes to `main`, `master`, `codex/**`, `claude/**`, `gemini/**`, `opencode/**`, and `copilot/**` branches.
When a dedicated feature branch has implemented the requirements of a Lastenheft, rename that file to `Lastenheft_<topic>.<feature-branch>.md` so the delivered scope stays traceable.

## Active Feature Context

### 004-editor-file-help-streams
- Current implementation baseline: execute the phase-6 increment from `specs/004-editor-file-help-streams/spec.md` and `specs/004-editor-file-help-streams/plan.md`
- Scope is limited to reusable framework components in `src/TuiVision.Controls` and `src/TuiVision.Serialization`: `TEditor`, `TMemo`, `TFileEditor`, `TEditWindow`, file/dialog/history helpers, help topics/viewers/windows, stream primitives, and named resource containers
- Out of scope for this increment: example applications such as `tvedit`, `bhelp`, and `helpdemo`; driver consolidation; calculator/macros/OS-shell integrations; and unrelated specialized widgets
- Editor flows must cover text editing, insert/overwrite behavior, clipboard-oriented actions, search/replace, modified-state handling, explicit safe-close decisions before unsaved changes are discarded, and distinct overwrite decisions when save conflicts occur
- Integration coverage for this feature must explicitly include event-loop-aware shell interaction, focus transitions, menu execution, and dialog interaction rather than relying on those behaviors only implicitly
- File flows must keep directory navigation, file lists, current file-information metadata, wildcard filtering, manual path entry, and history recall synchronized inside reusable dialogs
- Help flows must support context-based topic lookup, cross-reference navigation, and fallback content for missing contexts
- Stream/resource flows must preserve named lookup semantics and reject malformed persisted input explicitly, including truncated, trailing, unknown-type, and cyclic payload failures
- Planning decisions now fixed for this feature: dedicated runtime help files, shared-reference preservation without cyclic-graph support, exact case-sensitive resource keys, `LF` default for new files, preserved line endings for loaded files, and explicit overwrite decisions after external file changes

### 005-driver-consolidation-m07
- Current planning baseline: execute the Phase-7 increment from `specs/005-driver-consolidation-m07/spec.md` and `specs/005-driver-consolidation-m07/plan.md`
- Scope is limited to the managed driver baseline in `src/TuiVision.Drivers.Console`, the supporting validation in `tests/TuiVision.Drivers.Tests`, and the proof ledger `docs/porting-status.md`
- Out of scope for this increment: mandatory example waves, full closure of the Phase-8 entrance gate, new source modules, native bindings, and any one-to-one recreation of the historical per-OS driver split
- The proof ledger must cover every historical `.cc` implementation file in `tv203s/contrib/tvision/classes` with one mandatory primary target, optional secondary targets, status, evidence, and rationale
- Linux and Windows/WSL compatibility checks are required as reviewable evidence for this phase, but may still be manual or semi-automated rather than mandatory CI gates
- Planning decisions now fixed for this feature: `.cc` files are the formal `M-07` ledger scope, ancillary `.c`/`.h` files may appear only as rationale support, capability buckets replace per-OS lineage as the review model, and Phase 7 remains distinct from the later full Phase-8 gate closure

### 006-close-phase8-gate
- Current planning baseline: execute the Phase-8 entrance-gate closure from `specs/006-close-phase8-gate/spec.md` and `specs/006-close-phase8-gate/plan.md`
- Scope is limited to final `M-07` proof closure plus the remaining gate evidence across `docs/porting-status.md`, `Pflichtenheft.md`, the existing module test projects plus any required Compatibility-focused validation additions, coverage evidence, formatting evidence, and API-documentation validation
- Out of scope for this increment: any of the 25 mandatory example waves, substitute follow-on example scope from `TVDEMOS/` or `TVFM/`, unrelated new framework features, and Phase-7 redesign beyond finalizing still-pending proof rows
- Every historical `.cc` ledger row must end in `portiert + getestet` or `bewusst ausgelassen + Begruendung`; no provisional `portiert + Test ausstehend` state may remain after closure is claimed
- Gate closure must package explicit build, full-test, coverage, formatting, and conditional API-doc evidence and keep example waves blocked until the closure is formally recorded
- Planning decisions now fixed for this feature: `docs/porting-status.md` stays the authoritative M-07 ledger; `TuiVision.Core`, `TuiVision.Controls`, `TuiVision.Serialization`, `TuiVision.Compatibility`, and `TuiVision.Drivers.Console` must each satisfy the explicit 70 % line-coverage gate with assembly-specific evidence; `tests/TuiVision.Compatibility.Tests/` is the planned dedicated Compatibility fallback suite when shared tests are insufficient; placeholder-only or no-op-only modules cannot satisfy that gate; gate-scope removals must update the proof surfaces in the same change; skipped or ignored gate-scoped tests require recorded tracked-issue references; unresolved local-versus-CI coverage conflicts block closure; and the closure needs a dedicated gate-marker or commit reference

### 012-interactive-wave2-demos
- Current implementation status: interactive Wave-2 demo polish is implemented on branch `012-interactive-wave2-demos`; final validation evidence is tracked in `specs/012-interactive-wave2-demos/pr-evidence.md`.
- Delivered scope is limited to making the eleven Wave-2 examples visibly operable at normal runtime: `Clipboard`, `Demo`, `DlgDsn`, `DynTxt`, `InpLis`, `ListVi`, `ProgBa`, `Sdlg`, `Sdlg2`, `TCombo`, and `TProgB`; matching event-loop smoke tests in `tests/TuiVision.Examples.SmokeTests/`; guides, README, `pr-evidence.md`, and proportional architecture/security/A11Y/statistics evidence.
- Before wiring or accepting each example, review the relevant historical `.c`/`.cc` source and any important matching headers under `tv203s/` as read-only reference, capture the original demo intent, and document intentional user-visible deviations in guide or PR evidence.
- Every example must show first-screen purpose text, expose primary behavior through menu, keyboard, status, or command paths, and update visible text-first feedback after each demonstrated operation.
- Primary smoke proof must run `app.Run()` or the equivalent real application loop with injected `TEvent`, command, or key events. Direct helper methods may support setup or supplemental assertions only.
- `examples/Demo` is the P1 vertical slice and must prove at least three visible behaviors before the pattern is spread across the rest of the examples.
- File/path and dialog-designer flows stay read-only toward user data: use source-controlled fixtures, fixed repository paths, or test temporary directories; do not read arbitrary user file contents or persist user history as proof.
- Wave 3 and Wave 4 examples, mandatory mouse-only operation, broad framework redesign, new runtime dependencies, databases, external services, and DocFX publishing-model changes are out of scope.
- Next open mandatory example scope after this feature is Wave 3: editor, file, help, and stream demos such as `tvedit`, `bhelp`, and `helpdemo`.

### 013-wave2-visual-component-remediation
- Current implementation status: visual component remediation is implemented on branch `013-wave2-visual-component-remediation`; final validation evidence is tracked in `specs/013-wave2-visual-component-remediation/pr-evidence.md`.
- Scope is limited to the eleven Wave-2 examples: `Clipboard`, `Demo`, `DlgDsn`, `DynTxt`, `InpLis`, `ListVi`, `ProgBa`, `Sdlg`, `Sdlg2`, `TCombo`, and `TProgB`.
- Shared runtime support for the remediated examples lives in `examples/Shared/Wave2Runtime.cs` and is linked into the eleven scoped example projects.
- The primary parity proof is the visible UI composition itself: controls, dialogs, windows, view groups, scroll groups, progress displays, input/list/combo composition, or another stable visible runtime state.
- Each example must use the three-layer model: visible main component, real `TStatusLine` feedback, and keyboard-reachable `Help -> Description`.
- Primary smokes must drive the real app loop and combine concrete state assertions with view-tree proof plus buffer/cell rendered visibility proof at expected positions or regions.
- Historical C/C++ sources under `tv203s/` remain read-only intent references; intentional user-visible deviations must be documented in plan, tasks, guides, feature evidence, or PR evidence.
- AI-SBOM is `N/A` for this feature while AI is only development/agent tooling; re-evaluate if runtime/product AI, models, datasets, AI infrastructure, or delivered AI components enter scope.
- Wave 3/4 functionality, broad framework redesign, mandatory mouse-only operation, arbitrary user-file proof, external proof paths, persistent user history, databases, external services, and new runtime dependencies are out of scope.

### 014-wave1-functional-hardening
- Current implementation status: Wave-1 functional hardening is implemented on branch `014-wave1-functional-hardening`; final validation evidence is tracked in `specs/014-wave1-functional-hardening/pr-evidence.md`.
- Scope is limited to `Desklogo`, `MsgCls`, `Tutorial` steps `tvguid01` through `tvguid16`, and `Videomode`.
- The primary proof surface is `specs/014-wave1-functional-hardening/pr-evidence.md`, which records historical source, C# behavior, proof method, helper classification, negative/fallback proof, missing-core decisions, intentional deviations, validation, and the archived Lastenheft path.
- Managed runtime behavior is proven by executable smoke tests; evidence-only proof remains allowed only for explicitly documented no-runtime-target deviations.
- Helper or headless paths may be `PrimaryProof` only when they execute real example or application logic through public commands, events, application methods, or stable public state with concrete assertions; 014 added `PrimaryProof`, `SupplementalProof`, `SetupOnly`, and `LegacyOrTemporary` helper taxonomy.
- Historical C/C++ sources under `tv203s/` remain read-only intent references. `set-logo.cc` and `tv_logo.cc` are Desklogo asset/generator boundary context only.
- Validation baseline: targeted Wave-1 smokes 38/38 passed, full example smokes 91/91 passed, full Release tests 496/496 passed, coverage gate exceeded 70% for all required assemblies, `docfx docfx.json` passed with 0 warnings/errors, and Playwright/axe DocFX smoke passed 2/2 via explicit local-server workaround when sandboxed webserver startup is blocked.
- Next open example-adjacent step is `Lastenheft_07_Didactic-Inline-Code-Comment-Hardening.md`; it remains before `Lastenheft_Wave1-Visual-Component-Remediation.md`.
- Wave-1 visual remediation, Wave 2/3/4 behavior, broad framework redesign, mouse-only operation, arbitrary user-file proof, external proof paths, persistent user history, databases, external services, new runtime dependencies, and runtime/product AI are out of scope.

### 015-didactic-comment-hardening
- Current planning baseline: execute the didactic inline-code-comment hardening from `specs/015-didactic-comment-hardening/spec.md` and `specs/015-didactic-comment-hardening/plan.md`.
- Scope is limited to selective didactic inline, block, file, or module comments, feature evidence in `specs/015-didactic-comment-hardening/pr-evidence.md`, and affected guidance/evidence surfaces.
- Review must cover central framework flows and relevant smoke-test helpers: event/command/dispatch, focus transitions, view hierarchy, StatusLine, Help/Description, dialog state, validation/rejection, buffer/cell proof, rendering snapshots, terminal fallbacks, historical Turbo Vision deviations, and proof helpers.
- Each reviewed area must receive exactly one decision: `CommentAdequate`, `CommentNeeded`, `NoCommentNeeded`, `UpdateExistingComment`, or `FollowUpHardening`.
- Comments remain moderate and reason-focused: explain why, trade-off, constraint, historical deviation, or proof boundary; avoid restating obvious code; use German-first/English-second CEFR-B2 text for didactic explanation blocks.
- XML comments remain the API/DocFX surface; pure `//` or `/* */` hardening does not trigger DocFX. XML/API/generated docs/navigation/guides changes trigger the normal DocFX plus A11Y path.
- No runtime behavior change, API change, new dependency, new example porting, broad framework revision, Wave-1 visual remediation, or runtime/product AI is in scope.

## Example Wave Delivery Pattern

- Larger mandatory example waves should use a deliberate two-stage Spec-Kit delivery model when framework gaps, porting logic, and interactive runtime polish would otherwise be mixed in one feature.
- Stage 1 is the functional port/proof feature: port historical example behavior, close framework prerequisites, expose deterministic headless or in-process smoke paths, add guides/evidence, and explicitly mark interactive runtime polish as follow-up when normal `dotnet run --project examples/<Name>` is not yet the final demonstration.
- Stage 2 is the interactive showcase feature: wire the proven functions into visible menus, status lines, desktop controls, dialogs, keyboard paths, and scripted UI-event smoke tests so the example is useful for learners and manual reviewers.
- Do not call an example wave fully learner-facing complete until Stage 2 is delivered, unless the scope explicitly defines the example as a minimal non-interactive proof.
- Future Lastenhefte for example waves or example-adjacent framework hardening MUST include a framework-usage and remediation gate. The later Spec-Kit run must document, per example or contract area, which existing TuiVision framework component is used, whether local special logic exists, and which decision applies: `UseExistingFramework`, `SmallFrameworkFix`, `IntentionalDeviation`, or `FollowUpHardening`.
- Reusable logic must not remain permanently as a local `examples/` special solution. If the same local logic would be useful in multiple examples or replaces framework behavior, move it into a small framework fix or record it as a dedicated follow-up hardening item.

## Gemeinsame Governance-Ergaenzung / Shared Governance Addendum

- Alle nutzerseitigen Artefakte muessen barrierefrei gedacht und geprueft werden: CLI-Ausgaben, Dokumentation, HTML, UI und generierte Templates; WCAG 2.2 Level AA ist die Standard-Basis, sobald die Kriterien auf das Artefakt anwendbar sind.
- All user-facing artefacts must be designed and reviewed for accessibility: CLI output, documentation, HTML, UI, and generated templates; WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the default baseline wherever the criteria apply.

- Fuer C#/.NET-Repositories gilt standardmaessig eine Thorsten-Solo-Basis von `125` Zeilen/Arbeitstag, sofern das Repo keinen abweichenden, begruendeten Wert dokumentiert.
- The default Thorsten-solo baseline for C#/.NET repositories is `125` lines/workday unless the repository documents a justified deviation.

- C# `latest` / C# 14 on .NET 10 (`net10.0`) + Existing TuiVision modules only: `TuiVision.Core`, `TuiVision.Controls`, `TuiVision.Serialization`, `TuiVision.Compatibility`, `TuiVision.Drivers.Console`; existing MSTest and Coverlet test stack; existing DocFX plus Playwright/axe web A11Y tooling.

The examples must not persist user history, write user data as part of normal demonstration, read arbitrary user file contents as proof, or add a database/external service. (012-interactive-wave2-demos)
- Runtime example state remains in memory. Controlled examples may use source-controlled fixtures, fixed repository paths, or test temporary directories for metadata, rendering, validation, or rejection proof. The feature must not add a database, external service, network dependency, persistent user history, or arbitrary user-file content reads. (013-wave2-visual-component-remediation)

No database, external service, network dependency, persistent user history, arbitrary user-file content reads, or runtime/product AI storage is planned. (014-wave1-functional-hardening)
- C# `latest` / C# 14 on .NET 10 (`net10.0`) + Existing TuiVision modules only: `TuiVision.Core`, `TuiVision.Controls`, `TuiVision.Serialization`, `TuiVision.Compatibility`, `TuiVision.Drivers.Console`; existing MSTest/Coverlet validation; existing DocFX plus Playwright/axe web A11Y tooling when documentation triggers apply. No new runtime NuGet dependency is planned. (015-didactic-comment-hardening)
- Source-controlled Markdown evidence and guidance files only. Production code state and tests keep their current storage model. No database, external service, network dependency, persistent user history, runtime/product AI storage, or arbitrary user-file proof path is planned. (015-didactic-comment-hardening)

### 007-port-wave1-examples
- Current status: Wave 1 delivered (2026-03-28). `desklogo`, `msgcls`, `tutorial` (16 steps), `videomode` are ported, smoke-tested, and guide-documented.
- Wave 1 scope: `examples/Desklogo/`, `examples/MsgCls/`, `examples/Tutorial/`, `examples/Videomode/`; shared smoke-test infrastructure in `tests/TuiVision.Examples.SmokeTests/`; guides in `docs/guides/examples/`.
- Next open scope: Wave 2 – Controls and Dialogs (requires Controls/Dialog layer as prerequisite before planning starts).
- Planning decisions now fixed: headless smoke seam via `bool headless` constructor parameter + `GetEvent()` override; in-process MSTest execution without external process spawning; bilingual German-first/English-second XML docs and comments at CEFR-B2; `DisplayModeCoordinator.ProbeResizeSupport()` cross-platform probe with CA1416 suppressed.

## Recent Changes
- 014-wave1-functional-hardening: Added plan artifacts for Wave-1 functional hardening, including historical proof matrix, smoke-proof, helper-classification, fallback, missing-core, documentation, and governance planning.
- 013-wave2-visual-component-remediation: Implemented visible main components or stable visual runtime states, real `TStatusLine` feedback, `Help -> Description`, shared `examples/Shared/Wave2Runtime.cs`, stricter app-loop rendered-visibility smokes, guides, README, architecture/security evidence, statistics, and PR evidence for all eleven Wave-2 examples.
- 004-editor-file-help-streams: Added the phase-6 specification and requirements checklist for editor, file, help, stream, and resource components.
- 004-editor-file-help-streams: Added `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `contracts/public-api.md`; synchronized shared agent guidance to the post-plan baseline.
- 004-editor-file-help-streams: Applied plan-review clarifications for safe-close vs. overwrite handling, wildcard-filtered file dialogs, explicit malformed-stream cases, and non-functional scope boundaries.
- 004-editor-file-help-streams: Added explicit coverage of insert/overwrite plus clipboard editor actions, synchronized file-information state in dialogs, shell menu/status routing, and the full Core/Controls/Serialization coverage gate.
- 004-editor-file-help-streams: Tightened the remaining integration-test expectations so event-loop dispatch, focus transitions, menu execution, and explicit dialog interaction are named directly in the feature artifacts.
- 005-driver-consolidation-m07: Added the phase-7 specification and clarification set for managed driver consolidation, `M-07` proof coverage, primary versus secondary ledger targets, and required Linux/Windows/WSL compatibility evidence.
- 005-driver-consolidation-m07: Added `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `contracts/phase-7-proof-contract.md` to define the capability-based driver consolidation approach, the formal `.cc` ledger scope, and the review contract for `docs/porting-status.md`.
- 005-driver-consolidation-m07: Implemented Phase-7 consolidation: created `DriverCapabilityMap.cs` with 5 capability buckets, built `docs/porting-status.md` covering all 151 historical `.cc` files, added 5 new driver test files (30 tests passing), updated `docs/guides/multi-mac-workflow.md` with compatibility evidence, created `checklists/phase-8-gate-review.md`, updated `Pflichtenheft.md` marker to Phase-8 gate closure.
- 006-close-phase8-gate: Added the Phase-8 entrance-gate specification and requirements checklist for final `M-07` closure, removal of provisional ledger states, and explicit build/test/coverage/format/API-doc proof before example waves may start.
- 006-close-phase8-gate: Synchronized the hard coverage rule to require `TuiVision.Core`, `TuiVision.Controls`, `TuiVision.Serialization`, `TuiVision.Compatibility`, and `TuiVision.Drivers.Console` each to reach at least 70 % line coverage across the shared agent guidance and gate-tracking artifacts.
- 006-close-phase8-gate: Added `plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`, and `contracts/phase-8-gate-contract.md` to define the final `M-07` closure workflow, the 5x-70%-coverage gate, the full-suite validation package, and the dedicated closure-commit contract.
- 006-close-phase8-gate: Refined the plan after clarification so the five-module coverage gate now requires assembly-specific reporting and rejects placeholder-only or no-op-only closure modules.
- 006-close-phase8-gate: Analyse-Remediation nach der Task-Pruefung nachgezogen: `gate-docs.md` als Planartefakt explizit benannt, `tests/TuiVision.Compatibility.Tests/` als feste Plan-Baseline aufgenommen und Skip/Ignore-Faelle nur noch mit dokumentierter Tracking-Issue-Referenz als gate-konform zugelassen.
- 007-port-wave1-examples: Wave 1 portiert: `desklogo` (minimale Desktop-App), `msgcls` (Broadcast-Nachrichtenrouting), `tutorial` (16 token-basierte Schritte), `videomode` (Faehigkeitserkennung + Fallback). 41 Smoke-Tests gruen, Release-Build sauber, `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` bestanden. `Pflichtenheft.md` Welle-1-Checkliste abgehakt, `>>> NAECHSTER SCHRITT <<<` auf Welle 2 vorgeschoben.

- 010-standard-dialogs-designer: Framework-Readiness fuer Standarddialoge und Dialog-Designer implementiert: explizite Datei-/Verzeichnisentscheidungen ohne Dateiinhalt-I/O, Color-/Display-/symbolische Charset-Auswahl, validierte Dialogbeschreibung, persistierter Dialogbeschreibungs-Roundtrip und malformed-input rejection; fokussierte Controls- und Serialization-Tests gruen.
- 011-port-wave2-examples: Planartefakte fuer Welle 2 erstellt: 11 neue Beispielprojekte, dedizierte Example-Smoke-Tests, DE-first/EN-second Guides, Architektur-/Security-/A11Y-Nachweise und klarer `sdlg`/`sdlg2`-Scope als historische ScrollDialog/ScrollGroup-Beispiele.
- 012-interactive-wave2-demos: Interaktive Showcase-Stufe fuer Welle 2 implementiert: alle elf Wave-2-Beispiele besitzen sichtbare normale Runtime-Pfade, app-loop-basierte Smoke-Nachweise, aktualisierte Guides, README-, Architektur-/Security-/A11Y- und PR-Evidence.

## Agent File Synchronization Policy

- When active feature context, implementation-plan guidance, or other shared AI-agent instructions change, update the following files together when affected:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `GEMINI.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md`
- Do not leave shared guidance synchronized in only one of these files.
- If an agent-specific file needs intentional divergence, document the reason in the same change.

## Agentische Skriptausfuehrung / Agentic Script Execution

- Vor jeder Automationsaufgabe zuerst das Betriebssystem pruefen. Wenn ein passendes PowerShell-7-Skript oder Cmdlet vorhanden ist und `pwsh` verfuegbar ist, diese Variante bevorzugen. Fuer strukturierte lokale Automationen ist C# ueber `.NET` oder `mono` ein zulaessiger zweiter Weg, wenn Typisierung, Dateiformate oder Wiederverwendbarkeit dadurch klar besser werden. Erst wenn PowerShell oder C# nicht sinnvoll passen, die OS-nahe vorhandene Repo-Variante nutzen, auf macOS/Linux typischerweise Bash. Keine neue Sprache nur aus Bequemlichkeit einfuehren, wenn ein bestehendes Repo-Skript denselben Zweck erfuellt.
- Detect the operating system before each automation task. If a matching PowerShell 7 script or cmdlet exists and `pwsh` is available, prefer that variant. For structured local automation, C# via `.NET` or `mono` is an acceptable second option when type safety, file formats, or reuse clearly benefit from it. Only when PowerShell or C# is not a good fit, use the existing OS-native repository variant, typically Bash on macOS/Linux. Do not introduce a new language merely for convenience when an existing repository script already solves the task.

## Project Statistics

- Maintain `docs/project-statistics.md` as the living statistics ledger for the repository.
- Update the file after each completed Spec-Kit implementation phase, after each agent-driven repository change, or when a refresh is explicitly requested.
- Within the `## Fortschreibungsprotokoll` table, keep entries in strict chronological order: oldest entry at the top, newest and most recently added entry at the bottom; entries with the same date keep their insertion order.
- Keep a final top-level `## Gesamtstatistik` block as the last section of `docs/project-statistics.md`; no later top-level section should follow it.
- Inside that final `## Gesamtstatistik` block, maintain compact ASCII-only trend diagrams that show at least the current artifact mix, the documented branch/phase curves, the documented acceleration factors from agentic-AI plus Spec-Kit/SDD support, and a direct comparison between experienced-developer effort, Thorsten-solo effort, and the visible AI-assisted delivery window; refresh them whenever the statistics ledger changes.
- Keep each short CEFR-B2 explanation directly adjacent to its matching ASCII diagram group, ideally immediately before or after it, so apprentices do not need to scroll between explanation and diagram.
- When the data benefits from progression across an X-axis, add simple ASCII X/Y charts as a second visualization layer; keep them approximate, readable in plain Markdown, and explained in CEFR-B2 language.
- ASCII X/Y charts must use fixed-width X slots: every documented phase keeps its slot, missing values stay blank, and overly wide future series are split into labelled blocks such as `0..15`, `16..31`, and `32..47`, each with its own axis line and X labels.
- Keep the statistics section plain-text friendly for Braille displays, screen readers, and text browsers; the ASCII diagrams and their explanations must stay understandable without relying on color or visual layout alone.
- When DocFX content, documentation navigation, or API presentation changes, validate representative `_site/` pages through a text-oriented review path, preferably with a local Playwright accessibility snapshot.
- Use WCAG 2.2 AA as the concrete review baseline for generated HTML documentation, especially for page language, bypass blocks, keyboard focus visibility, non-text contrast, and readable landmark structure.
- Each update must capture branch/phase, observable work window, production/test/documentation line counts, main work packages, the conservative manual baseline of 80 code lines per day for an experienced developer, and the repo-specific Thorsten-Solo comparison baseline of 125 lines per workday for this Pascal/Turbo-Vision-derived port.
- When reporting acceleration, compare both manual references against visible Git active days and label the result as a blended repository speedup rather than a stopwatch measurement.
- When hour values are shown, convert the day-based estimates with the TVoeD working-day baseline of `7.8 hours` (`7h 48m`) per day.

## Workflow Platforms

- The Multi-Mac setup on `MacBook Air M2` and `Mac mini M4 Pro` is the primary development and day-to-day test workflow.
- Keep `gh`, `specify`, `codex`, `claude`, `copilot`, and `gemini` installed on both Macs; before Spec-Kit work or Spec-Kit updates, run `specify check` to confirm the required toolchain is available.
- After every `/speckit-plan` run or equivalent plan refresh that changes active technologies, project structure, or agent context, run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh` for `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, and `copilot` in the same work item by default. Treat this multi-agent context refresh as routine maintenance that does not need a separate user prompt.
- Linux and Windows are additional compatibility-validation environments; on Windows, prefer WSL with a current Ubuntu release, currently `Ubuntu 24.04`.
- When changes affect runtime behavior, build reliability, terminal behavior, or portability, include Linux and Windows/WSL compatibility checks where practical and reflect them in CI or equivalent validation evidence when feasible.

## Pflichtenheft Next-Step Marker

- Maintain a prominent `>>> NAECHSTER SCHRITT <<<` marker in `Pflichtenheft.md`.
- The marker MUST point to the currently highest-priority open work item in the prioritized rest-work section and MUST be moved whenever progress changes the effective next step.

## Shared Parent Guidance

- The shared parent file `/Users/thorstenhindermann/RiderProjects/AGENTS.md` intentionally stores only repo-spanning baseline rules.
- Keep repository-specific build, test, workflow, architecture, and feature guidance in this repository's own files; when both layers exist, the repository-local files are the more specific authority.

## Level-2-Umgebungsregister / Level-2 Environment Registry

- Die zentrale `constitution.md` enthält das verbindliche Level-2 Project Environment Registry.
- Spec-Kit-Pläne und Claude-Arbeit in Level-2-Projekten müssen die passende Registry-Zeile als verbindlichen Kontext für Runtime, Build/Test, A11Y, Statistik und Agentenflächen verwenden.
- Änderungen an einer Level-2-Runtime, Toolchain oder Statistik-Basis müssen `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md` und betroffene KI-Agenten-Dateien gemeinsam prüfen.

*The central `constitution.md` contains the binding Level-2 Project Environment Registry. Spec-Kit plans and Claude work in Level-2 projects must use the matching registry row as binding context for runtime, build/test, A11Y, statistics, and agent surfaces. Changes to Level-2 runtime, toolchain, or statistics baselines require a joint review of `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and affected AI-agent files.*
## Memory-Safe Languages (MSL) / Speichersichere Sprachen

- Level-2-Projekte SOLLEN eine speichersichere Sprache (Memory-Safe Language, MSL) als primäre Laufzeit verwenden, wenn die Zielplattform es erlaubt.
- Verbindliche MSL-Erlaubnisliste, Regeln und Begründungspflicht: siehe `constitution.md`, Prinzip XI.
- MSL-Kurzliste: Rust, Swift, C#, F#, Java, Kotlin, Scala, Go, Dart, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang, Elixir, Ada, SPARK.
- **Nicht** MSL (Begründung im Level-2-`constitution.md` erforderlich): C, C++, klassisches Objective-C, Assembly, `cc65`-C89, Zig (pre-1.0), Nim (manual), D ohne GC.
- In Nicht-MSL-Repositories (z. B. `C64Projects/cc65`) die im Level-2-`constitution.md` hinterlegte Begründung im Plan- und Task-Kontext erwähnen.
- `speckit.constitution` und `speckit.specify` SOLLEN bei Nicht-MSL-Primärsprache einen **nicht blockierenden** Hinweis ausgeben (Tooling-Aufgabe, separate Umsetzung).
- Änderungen an dieser Empfehlung erfordern ein gemeinsames Update in `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` und `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

*Level-2 projects SHOULD use a memory-safe language (MSL) as their primary runtime when the target platform allows. Authoritative rules: `constitution.md`, Principle XI. MSL short list: Rust, Swift, C#/F#, Java/Kotlin/Scala, Go, Dart, Python, Ruby, JavaScript/TypeScript, Haskell, OCaml, Erlang/Elixir, Ada/SPARK. Non-MSL languages (C, C++, Assembly, `cc65`, Zig pre-1.0, …) require a documented justification in the Level-2 `constitution.md`. In non-MSL repositories (e.g. `C64Projects/cc65`), surface the documented justification in plans and tasks. `speckit.constitution` and `speckit.specify` SHOULD emit a non-blocking advisory warning when the primary language is not an MSL — tracked as a separate tooling task. Changes to this recommendation require a joint update across `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and all four agent guidance files.*
## Sichere Code-Erzeugung / Secure Code Generation (ISO 27001/27002 A.8.28)

- KI-generierter und menschlich geschriebener Code MUSS den etablierten Secure-Coding-Best-Practices der Zielsprache und des Frameworks folgen. LLMs erzeugen nicht zuverlässig sicheren Code; explizite Durchsetzung ist erforderlich.
- Verbindliche Regeln und sprachspezifische Anforderungen: siehe `constitution.md`, Prinzip XII.
- Sprachspezifische Kurzregeln (Detailprofil: `.specify/templates/secure-coding-language-rules-template.md`):
  - **C / C89**: Bounds-Checking, kein `gets()`, kein ungeprueftes `sprintf()`/`strcpy()`, CERT C.
  - **C# / .NET**: parametrisierte Queries, Output-Encoding gegen XSS, Anti-Forgery-Tokens, sichere Deserialisierung, Microsoft Secure Coding Guidelines.
  - **Rust**: `unsafe` isolieren und begruenden, keine Panic-Pfade aus nicht vertrauenswuerdigem Input, Deserialisierung validieren, `cargo audit` oder gleichwertig verwenden.
  - **Go**: HTTP-/Client-Timeouts setzen, `context` propagieren, SSRF pruefen, `crypto/rand` nutzen, `govulncheck` oder gleichwertig verwenden.
  - **Swift**: keine Force-Unwraps auf nicht vertrauenswuerdigen Daten, dekodierte Eingaben validieren, Keychain/CryptoKit/TLS-Defaults nutzen, Datei-URLs einschraenken.
  - **Java / Kotlin**: DTOs validieren, Persistence-Zugriffe parametrisieren, Deserialisierung beschraenken, Auth/CSRF/CORS/Session-Defaults pruefen.
  - **Python**: Boundary-Input validieren, keine unsichere Deserialisierung oder dynamische Ausfuehrung, `subprocess`/Dateipfade einschraenken, Dependency-Audit nutzen.
  - **TypeScript / JavaScript**: Runtime-Input validieren, XSS/Prototype-Pollution/SSRF pruefen, keine dynamische Code-Ausfuehrung, Lockfiles auditieren.
  - **SQL**: nur parametrisierte Statements, kein dynamisches SQL aus nicht vertrauenswuerdigem Input.
  - **Bash**: Variable in Anfuehrungszeichen (`"$var"`), kein `eval` auf nicht vertrauenswuerdigem Input, `--` End-of-Options.
  - **PowerShell**: `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest`, validierte Parameter, kein `Invoke-Expression` auf nicht vertrauenswuerdigem Input.
- Kryptografie: aktuelle Algorithmen (AES-256, RSA >= 3072, SHA-256+, Ed25519); veraltete (MD5, SHA-1 für Signaturen, DES, RC4) nur mit expliziter Risikobegründung.
- Fehlerbehandlung darf keine internen Zustände, Stack-Traces oder Verbindungszeichenketten an Endbenutzer preisgeben.
- Hinzugefügte Abhängigkeiten müssen aktiv gepflegt sein und dürfen keine bekannten kritischen CVEs aufweisen.
- Code-Reviews MÜSSEN eine Sicherheitsperspektive für Eingabeverarbeitung, Authentifizierung, Autorisierung, Kryptografie und Datei-/Netzwerk-I/O enthalten.
- Änderungen an dieser Regel erfordern ein gemeinsames Update in `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` und `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

*AI-generated and human-written code MUST follow the secure-coding best practices of the target language and framework. Authoritative rules: `constitution.md`, Principle XII, and `.specify/templates/secure-coding-language-rules-template.md`. Language-specific short rules cover C/C89, C#/.NET, Rust, Go, Swift, Java/Kotlin, Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, SQL, Bash, and PowerShell. MSL status does not replace secure API, I/O, auth, SQL, crypto, logging, or dependency review. Cryptography: use current algorithms (AES-256, SHA-256+, Ed25519); deprecated (MD5, SHA-1 for signatures, DES, RC4) only with explicit risk acknowledgement. Error handling must not expose internals. Dependencies must have no known critical CVEs. Code reviews must include a security perspective for input handling, auth, crypto, and I/O. Changes require a joint update across `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and all four agent guidance files.*
## Sichere Software-Architektur / Secure Software Architecture (ISO 27001/27002 A.8.27)

- KI-generierte und menschlich geschriebene Software-Architektur MUSS etablierten sicheren Architekturprinzipien folgen. Sicherer Code (Prinzip XII) ohne sichere Architektur reicht nicht aus — beide Ebenen müssen zusammenwirken.
- Verbindliche Regeln und sprachspezifische Architekturvorgaben: siehe `constitution.md`, Prinzip XIII.
- Verbindliche Architekturprinzipien:
  - **Trust Boundaries**: Explizite Vertrauensgrenzen definieren; alle Eingaben an Vertrauensgrenzen validieren und bereinigen.
  - **Defense in Depth**: Mindestens zwei unabhängige Sicherheitsschichten für kritische Assets.
  - **Least Privilege**: Jede Komponente, jeder Dienst und Prozess arbeitet mit minimalen Berechtigungen.
  - **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Zugriff standardmäßig verweigern, explizit gewähren; Fehlerpfade fallen in sicheren Zustand zurück.
  - **Angriffsfläche reduzieren**: Ungenutzte Endpunkte, Dienste und Debug-Funktionen deaktivieren oder entfernen.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Authentifizierung, Autorisierung, Logging und Eingabevalidierung als Cross-Cutting Concerns implementieren, nicht ad-hoc verstreuen.
  - **Sichere Konfiguration**: Secrets in plattformgeeigneten Secret-Stores (z. B. Azure Key Vault, macOS Keychain), nie im Quellcode oder in Git-tracked Config-Dateien.
  - **Supply-Chain-Sicherheit**: Abhängigkeiten aus verifizierten Registries; Lock-Files committen; verwundbare Abhängigkeiten vor Release ersetzen.
- Änderungen an dieser Regel erfordern ein gemeinsames Update in `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` und `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

*AI-generated and human-written software architecture MUST follow secure-architecture principles. Authoritative rules: `constitution.md`, Principle XIII. Core principles: trust boundaries (validate all input at system boundaries), defense in depth (at least two independent security layers), least privilege (minimum required permissions), fail-safe defaults (deny by default), attack surface reduction (disable unused features), separation of concerns (auth/logging/validation as cross-cutting concerns), secure configuration (secrets in secret stores, never in code or Git), supply-chain security (verified registries, lock files, no known-vulnerable dependencies). Principles XII + XIII together form the complete secure-development approach: XII = tactical code-level security, XIII = strategic architecture-level security. Changes require a joint update across `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and all four agent guidance files.*
## Allgemeine Architektur-Governance / General Architecture Governance (iSAQB / arc42)

- Architektur MUSS als explizites Arbeitsergebnis behandelt werden, wenn Struktur, Schnittstellen, Qualitätsattribute, Laufzeitverhalten, Deployment, Wartbarkeit oder technische Schulden betroffen sind.
- Verbindliche Regeln: siehe `constitution.md`, Prinzip XX; Architektur-Evidenz liegt standardmaessig unter `docs/architecture/`.
- Relevante Artefakte: Architecture Vision, Context View, Building-Block View, Runtime View, Deployment View, Quality Scenarios, Architecture Decision Records und Architecture Risks/Technical Debt.
- In `spec.md`, `plan.md` und `tasks.md` immer festhalten, ob Architektur-Evidenz erforderlich ist; `N/A` nur mit kurzer Begruendung.
- Bei sicherheitsrelevanter Architektur zusaetzlich die Secure-Architecture- und Security-Evidenz aus `docs/security/` anwenden.

*Architecture MUST be treated as an explicit work product when structure, interfaces, quality attributes, runtime behavior, deployment, maintainability, or technical debt are affected. Authoritative rules: `constitution.md`, Principle XX. Default evidence lives under `docs/architecture/`: architecture vision, context, building blocks, runtime, deployment, quality scenarios, ADRs, and architecture risks/technical debt. `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` must state whether this evidence applies; `N/A` requires rationale. Security-relevant architecture also uses the secure-architecture evidence under `docs/security/`.*
## Sicherheitsdokumentation / Security Documentation (XII–XVIII Extensions)

- Jedes Level-2-Projekt MUSS die folgenden Sicherheitsdokumente pflegen, basierend auf den Templates in `.specify/templates/`:
  - **Bedrohungsmodell / Threat Model** (`threat-model-template.md`) — STRIDE-Methodik, Trust Boundaries, Risikobewertung, CAPEC-Referenzen (Prinzip XIII + XVII)
  - **Security Architecture Decision Records (S-ADR)** (`adr-template.md`) — architektonische Sicherheitsentscheidungen mit Compliance-Nachweis (Prinzip XIII)
  - **arc42 Section 8 Sicherheits-Querschnittskonzepte** (`arc42-security-template.md`) — Authentifizierung, Autorisierung, Verschlüsselung, Eingabevalidierung, Fehlerbehandlung, Logging, Abhängigkeiten, Deployment (Prinzip XIII)
  - **Sicherheits-Checkliste / Security Checklist** (`security-checklist-template.md`) — sprachspezifische Code-Review-Checkliste (Prinzip XII)
  - **Abhängigkeits-Audit / Dependency Audit** (`dependency-audit-template.md`) — CVE-Tracking, Lizenz-Compliance, Supply-Chain-Sicherheit (Prinzip XII)
  - **Sicherheits-Qualitätsszenarien / Security Quality Scenarios** (`security-quality-scenarios-template.md`) — iSAQB CPSA-F Qualitätsszenario-Methodik (Prinzip XII + XIII, SHOULD)
  - **ASVS-Verifikation / ASVS Verification** (`asvs-verification-template.md`) — OWASP ASVS Level, Scope und Evidenz (Prinzip XV, Web-/API-Projekte MUST)
  - **Supply-Chain-Evidenz / Supply Chain Evidence** (`supply-chain-evidence-template.md`) — SBOM, AI-SBOM, VEX, SLSA, OpenSSF Scorecard (Prinzip XVI, releasefähige Projekte MUST; AI-SBOM nur bei KI-Runtime-/Produktkomponenten)
  - **Zero-Trust-Anwendbarkeit / Zero Trust Applicability** (`zero-trust-applicability-template.md`) — NIST SP 800-207-Bewertung (Prinzip XVIII, verteilte Systeme SHOULD)
  - **SAMM-Bewertung / SAMM Assessment** (`samm-assessment-template.md`) — OWASP SAMM Reifegrad und Verbesserungsplan (Prinzip XVIII, langlebige Projekte SHOULD)
- Projektspezifische Instanzen werden in `docs/security/` gepflegt; S-ADRs als einzelne Dateien in `docs/security/adr/`.

*Every Level-2 project MUST maintain security documents based on templates in `.specify/templates/`: threat model (STRIDE+CAPEC), S-ADRs, arc42 Section 8 security concepts, security checklist, dependency audit, security quality scenarios (SHOULD), ASVS verification (web/API MUST), supply-chain evidence (release-capable MUST; AI-SBOM when AI runtime/product components apply), Zero Trust applicability note (distributed systems SHOULD), and SAMM assessment (long-lived projects SHOULD). Project-specific instances live in `docs/security/`; S-ADRs in `docs/security/adr/`. See `constitution.md`, Principles XII–XVIII for authoritative requirements.*

## Sicherheitsstandards & Anwendbarkeit / Security Standards & Applicability

- Vor jeder Level-2-Aufgabe die anwendbaren Sicherheitsstandards aus `constitution.md`, Prinzipien XIV-XVIII bestimmen und explizit benennen.
- `NIST SSDF` und `CWE Top 25` gelten immer für Level-2-Arbeit.
- `OWASP ASVS` gilt für Web-, API-, HTTP- und authentifizierte Dienste; der gewählte ASVS-Level muss benannt werden.
- `SBOM` gilt für releasefähige oder verteilbare Artefakte; `VEX`, wenn bekannte Schwachstellen in ausgelieferten oder geprüften Komponenten bewertet werden müssen.
- `AI-SBOM` gilt projektartabhängig bei KI-Modellen, KI-Diensten, Trainings-/Embedding-Daten, Inferenz-Infrastruktur oder KI-Runtime-Komponenten im ausgelieferten oder betriebenen System; reine Entwicklungswerkzeug-Nutzung wird als `N/A` mit Toolchain-Begründung dokumentiert.
- `SLSA` gilt als Soll-Vorgabe für CI/CD- oder veröffentlichte Artefakte; `Zero Trust` ist für verteilte, servicebasierte, cloudnahe oder remote-verwaltete Systeme explizit zu prüfen.
- `CAPEC` soll in Bedrohungsmodellen für die risikoreichsten Angriffswege verwendet werden; `OWASP SAMM` soll für langlebige Projekte/Workspaces in Verbesserungspläne einfließen.
- `OWASP Cheat Sheet Series`, `OWASP Proactive Controls` und bei öffentlichen OSS-Repositories oder kritischen Abhängigkeiten `OpenSSF Scorecard` sind als ergänzende Referenzen zu berücksichtigen.
- Nichtanwendbarkeit immer als `N/A` mit kurzer Begründung dokumentieren; keine stillschweigende Auslassung.

*At the start of every Level-2 task, determine and name the applicable security standards from `constitution.md`, Principles XIV-XVIII. `NIST SSDF` and `CWE Top 25` always apply. `OWASP ASVS` applies to web/API/HTTP/auth-bearing services; `SBOM` applies to releasable or distributable artefacts; `AI-SBOM` applies when AI models, AI services, datasets, inference infrastructure, or AI runtime components are part of the released or operated system; `VEX` applies when known vulnerabilities in shipped/evaluated components need a disposition statement. `SLSA` is the target model for CI/CD and published artefacts; `Zero Trust` must be explicitly evaluated for distributed, service-based, cloud, or remotely managed systems. `CAPEC`, `OWASP SAMM`, `OWASP Cheat Sheet Series`, `OWASP Proactive Controls`, and `OpenSSF Scorecard` are supporting references where relevant. Record non-applicability as `N/A` with justification rather than omitting it silently.*

## Agentischer Security-Workflow / Agentic Security Workflow

- In `spec.md`, `plan.md` und `tasks.md` die anwendbaren Standards samt Evidenzpfad festhalten.
- Bei Bedrohungsmodellen `STRIDE` als Basis und bei risikoreichen Flows zusätzlich relevante `CAPEC`-Patterns verwenden.
- Bei Web/API-Features den `ASVS`-Level und den Verifikationsumfang in `docs/security/` oder gleichwertiger Projektdokumentation ablegen.
- KI-Nutzung explizit klassifizieren: Entwicklungswerkzeug, keine KI im ausgelieferten/betriebenen System, oder KI-Runtime-/Produktkomponente; `AI-SBOM` entsprechend als `N/A` begründen oder in der Supply-Chain-Evidenz dokumentieren.
- Bei Release-/Artefakt-Arbeit `SBOM`, `AI-SBOM`, `VEX`, Provenance/SLSA-Nachweise und gegebenenfalls `OpenSSF Scorecard` in Release- oder Sicherheitsdokumentation einplanen.
- Bei Architekturänderungen `Zero Trust`-Anwendbarkeit und bei langlebigen Projekten `SAMM`-Folgeaktionen prüfen.
- Default-Evidenzpfad: `docs/security/asvs-verification.md`, `docs/security/supply-chain-evidence.md`, `docs/security/zero-trust-applicability.md`, `docs/security/samm-assessment.md`; Abweichungen nur mit lokal dokumentierter Begründung.

*Capture the applicable standards and the evidence path in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md`. Use `STRIDE` as the base for threat modeling and add relevant `CAPEC` patterns for the highest-risk flows. For web/API work, record the chosen `ASVS` level and verification scope in `docs/security/` or equivalent project documentation. Classify AI usage as development tooling, absent from the released/operated system, or AI runtime/product component; document `AI-SBOM` as `N/A` or as supply-chain evidence accordingly. For release and artefact work, plan `SBOM`, `AI-SBOM`, `VEX`, provenance/SLSA evidence, and `OpenSSF Scorecard` review where applicable. For architectural changes, evaluate `Zero Trust`; for long-lived projects, consider `OWASP SAMM` follow-up actions. The default evidence path is `docs/security/asvs-verification.md`, `docs/security/supply-chain-evidence.md`, `docs/security/zero-trust-applicability.md`, and `docs/security/samm-assessment.md`, unless the repository documents a justified equivalent location.*

## GitHub/GitLab CLI First / GitHub/GitLab CLI zuerst

Für GitHub-Repositories zuerst die authentifizierte `gh` CLI für mögliche Schreibaktionen und Live-Repository-Operationen verwenden, einschließlich PR-/Issue-Kommentaren, PR-Statusprüfungen, Review-Follow-up, Workflow-Prüfung und Merge-/Statusabfragen. GitHub-Connector-Tools hauptsächlich für strukturierte Read-only-Inspektion oder Fälle nutzen, in denen die CLI nicht geeignet ist.

Für GitLab-Repositories die authentifizierte `glab` CLI zuerst für gleichwertige Aktionen verwenden. Bekanntermaßen fehlschlagende Connector-Schreibwege nicht wiederholt versuchen, wenn `gh`/`glab` die Aufgabe direkt erledigen kann.

For GitHub repositories, use the authenticated `gh` CLI first for feasible write actions and live repository operations, including PR/issue comments, PR status checks, review follow-up, workflow inspection, and merge/status queries. Use GitHub connector tools mainly for structured read-only inspection or when the CLI is not suitable.

For GitLab repositories, use the authenticated `glab` CLI first for equivalent actions. Do not repeatedly try connector write paths that are known to fail when `gh`/`glab` can perform the task directly.


## Spec-Kit-Modell-Routing / Spec Kit Model Routing

- Modellwahl ist operative Agenten-Routing-Guidance, keine Feature-Anforderung. Modellnamen nicht in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` oder einzelne Feature-Specs schreiben; diese Artefakte muessen reproduzierbar bleiben, auch wenn Modellnamen wechseln oder ein anderer KI-Agent verwendet wird.
- Der jeweilige Agent soll diese Empfehlungen auf seine aktuell verfuegbaren Modelle abbilden; keine feste Anbieter- oder Modellbindung ableiten.
- Fuer Spec-Kit-Spezifikation, Klaerung, Planung, Tasks und Analyse (`/speckit-specify`, `/speckit-clarify`, `/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, `/speckit-analyze`; je nach Agent auch `/speckit.specify` usw.) das staerkste verfuegbare Frontier-Reasoning-/Coding-Modell bevorzugen.
- Fuer vollstaendige, lang laufende `/speckit-implement`-Laeufe das staerkste verfuegbare Long-Running-Agent-Modell bevorzugen; das Frontier-Modell nutzen, wenn maximale Urteilsguete wichtiger ist als Laufzeitstabilitaet.
- Fuer fokussierte Reviews oder CI-Fixes ein coding-optimiertes Modell bevorzugen.
- Fuer triviale Bereinigung, Formatierung oder risikoarme mechanische Edits ist ein schnelles kleines Coding-Modell akzeptabel.

*Model choice is operational agent-routing guidance, not a feature requirement. Do not pin model names in `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, or individual feature specs; those artifacts must stay reproducible even when model names change or another AI agent is used. Each agent should map these recommendations to its currently available models; do not derive a fixed vendor or model requirement. For Spec-Kit specification, clarification, planning, task generation, and analysis (`/speckit-specify`, `/speckit-clarify`, `/speckit-plan`, `/speckit-tasks`, `/speckit-analyze`; or `/speckit.specify` etc. depending on the agent surface), prefer the strongest available frontier reasoning/coding model. For complete long-running `/speckit-implement` runs, prefer the strongest available long-running agent model; use the frontier model when maximum judgment quality is more important than runtime stability. For focused review or CI fixes, prefer a coding-optimized model. For trivial cleanup, formatting, or low-risk mechanical edits, a fast small coding model is acceptable.*

## Spec-Kit-Preset-Pflege / Spec Kit Preset Maintenance

- Standard-Preset-Set: `security-governance` v0.6.0 prio 10, `architecture-governance` v0.5.0 prio 20, `isaqb-architecture-governance` v0.2.0 prio 30, `a11y-governance` v0.4.0 prio 40, `cross-platform-governance` v0.2.0 prio 50, `agent-parity-governance` v0.3.0 prio 60.
- `a11y-governance` v0.4.0 ergaenzt didaktische Inline-Code-Kommentar-Governance fuer neue oder geaenderte nicht-triviale Logik.
- `security-governance` v0.6.0 fuehrt `AI-SBOM` weiter als bedingt anwendbare Supply-Chain-Evidenz, ergaenzt sprachspezifische Secure-Coding-Profile und ergaenzt regulatorische Anwendbarkeit fuer NIS2, CRA, EU AI Act und DORA. Reine Entwicklungswerkzeug-Nutzung bleibt `N/A`; KI-Runtime-/Produktkomponenten benoetigen Evidenz nach G7/BSI AI-SBOM-Clustern; private Ausbildungsprojekte dokumentieren regulatorische Nichtanwendbarkeit mit kurzer Begruendung.
- `architecture-governance` v0.5.0 ergaenzt `BSI C3A` als bedingte Cloud-Autonomie-Evidenz und `BSI C5` als bedingte Cloud-Compliance-Assurance-Evidenz fuer Cloud-Service-Auswahl, Provider-Abhaengigkeiten, Audit-/Nachweisstand, Shared Responsibility und Betriebsnachweise.
- Alle sechs Presets enthalten ab diesem Release-Block audit-ready Spec-Kit-Run-Evidenz: `Applicable` / `N/A` / `Open`, Begruendung, Evidenzpfad, Reviewer, Restrisiko und Follow-up muessen im aktuellen Spec-Kit-Lauf dokumentiert werden.
- Alle sechs Presets sind seit 2026-05-04 im `github/spec-kit` Community-Katalog enthalten und liegen zusätzlich als veröffentlichte Repos unter `https://github.com/hindermath/spec-kit-preset-*`.
- Neue Level-2-Projekte SOLLEN bei der Spec-Kit-Initialisierung die passende Preset-Teilmenge installieren; C#/.NET-Level-2-Projekte verwenden standardmäßig alle sechs Presets, sofern keine begründete Ausnahme dokumentiert ist.
- Referenz-Rollout für alle sechs Presets: `RiderProjects/TinyPl0`, `RiderProjects/TinyCalc`, `RiderProjects/TuiVision`, `RiderProjects/InventarWorkerService`.
- Installation bevorzugt über den Community-Katalog, wenn `specify` das unterstützt; für reproduzierbare Pins die versionierten GitHub-ZIP-URLs aus `constitution.md`/`README.md` verwenden.
- `.specify/presets/` und generierte Agenten-/Command-Dateien committen, wenn Presets Projekt-Policy sind; `.specify/presets/.cache/` nie committen.
- Nach Installation oder Update prüfen: `specify preset list`, mindestens ein `specify preset info <id>`, bei Template-Fragen zusätzlich `specify preset resolve <template>`.
- Die lokale Arbeitskopie der veröffentlichten Preset-Repos liegt unter `~/SpecKitPresetProjects/`; kanonische Scaffolds in diesem Repo liegen unter `specs/spec-kit-presets/` und `specs/spec-kit-preset-repos/`.
- Verbesserungen an Presets zuerst im `home-baseline`-Scaffold einarbeiten, dann in die passenden Repos unter `~/SpecKitPresetProjects/` übertragen, committen, pushen und mit GitHub-ZIP-URL smoke-testen.
- Bei Änderungen an Preset-Regeln immer prüfen, ob `constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` und `scripts/templates/*` ebenfalls aktualisiert werden müssen.
- Bei jeder Preset-Version oder Prioritätsänderung die kompakte Preset-Tabelle und ZIP-Installationsbefehle in `README.md`, die Matrix in `constitution.md`/`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, die vier Agenten-Dateien, `scripts/templates/speckit-workflow-section.md` und die Agenten-Templates gemeinsam aktualisieren.
- Community-/Katalog-Abstimmung läuft über `github/spec-kit#2362`.

*Standard preset set: `security-governance` v0.6.0 prio 10, `architecture-governance` v0.5.0 prio 20, `isaqb-architecture-governance` v0.2.0 prio 30, `a11y-governance` v0.4.0 prio 40, `cross-platform-governance` v0.2.0 prio 50, and `agent-parity-governance` v0.3.0 prio 60. `a11y-governance` v0.4.0 adds didactic inline-code-comment governance for new or changed non-trivial logic. `architecture-governance` v0.5.0 adds conditional `BSI C3A` cloud-autonomy evidence and `BSI C5` cloud-compliance assurance evidence for cloud-service selection, provider dependencies, audit/assurance status, shared responsibility, and operational evidence. `security-governance` v0.6.0 keeps conditional `AI-SBOM` evidence, language-specific secure-coding profiles, and regulatory applicability screening for NIS2, CRA, EU AI Act, and DORA: development-tool-only AI usage is `N/A`, AI runtime/product components require G7/BSI AI-SBOM cluster evidence, and private training projects record regulatory `N/A` when no regulated scope exists. All six presets now include audit-ready Spec-Kit run evidence: `Applicable` / `N/A` / `Open`, rationale, evidence path, reviewer, residual risk, and follow-up must be documented for the current Spec-Kit run. All six presets are in the `github/spec-kit` community catalog as of 2026-05-04 and are also published under `https://github.com/hindermath/spec-kit-preset-*`. New Level-2 projects should install the applicable subset; C#/.NET Level-2 projects default to all six unless a justified exception is documented. Commit `.specify/presets/` and generated agent command updates when presets are project policy, but never commit `.specify/presets/.cache/`. Verify installs with `specify preset list`, `specify preset info`, and where relevant `specify preset resolve`. Improve presets in the home-baseline scaffold first, propagate to standalone preset repos, then commit, push, and smoke-test via GitHub ZIP URL. Preset-rule changes and preset version/priority changes require reviewing constitution, README tables/install snippets, all agent guidance files, and relevant templates together. Community/catalog coordination happens in `github/spec-kit#2362`.*
